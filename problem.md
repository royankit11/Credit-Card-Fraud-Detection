### 2.1 Problem

Credit card fraud is a rare but high-impact problem, costing billions annually in financial losses and eroding trust in online payments. Because fraudulent transactions are hidden among millions of legitimate ones, detection is difficult: fraud patterns shift over time, labeled data is scarce, and false alarms can frustrate customers. These challenges create a pressing need for models that can accurately distinguish fraud from normal activity while adapting to evolving attack strategies.

### 2.2 Motivation

Accurate fraud detection reduces financial losses, protects cardholders, and sustains trust in digital payments. Missed fraud leads to chargebacks and risks, while false alarms frustrate customers. Therefore, an effective system must balance detection with user experience, while also ensuring fairness across groups and safeguarding data privacy. To address these challenges, we will develop a model that leverages past transaction data to predict the likelihood of fraud.
